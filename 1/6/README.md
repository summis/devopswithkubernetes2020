Now staring project and connecting from outside is possible with:
```
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/summis/todo-app/v0.4/manifests/deployment.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/summis/todo-app/v0.4/manifests/service.yaml
```
Different versions of project are kept on different branches.
